**Today's Progress**: created this repo to commit to this challenge.:sweat_smile:

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Social media challenges, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it.This is still new for me, 
but I managed to figure out some basic functionality and I have a kinda roadmap in my mind - starting with my side-project and then learn more about 
*js* and will continue to practice *SQL on hackerrank* . For now i think i have a good start .	:innocent:
